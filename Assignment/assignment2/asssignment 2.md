##  CHAPTER 2: WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

## Group A: Short Questions (2 Marks)

### 1. Define the term ”Sitemap” in the planning phase.
**Answer:**
A sitemap is a graphic representation of a website’s structure, showing how all the various pages are interlinked.
Sitemap helps in laying out the website’s structure before starting its development. Sitemap also assists in cross-checking whether all

### 2. What is the purpose of the ”Launch” phase in web development?
**Answer:**
The Launch phase is where the site is put live for public use. This stage involves putting the site live on a server, making sure everything works okay, and making it available to the public.

### 3. Why is ”Documentation” important in the development lifecycle?
**Answer:**
Documentation is important because it records how the website is designed and built. It helps developers maintain, update, and troubleshoot the website in the future.

### 4. Differentiate between Front-end and Back-end development.
**Answer:**
Front end development involves working on the visual aspect of a website that is engaged by the users, including layout, design, and buttons. Back-end development handles server-side operations like databases, user authentication, and data processing.

## Group B: Long Questions (4 Marks)

### 5. ”Planning is the most critical phase of web development.” Discuss this statement by listing the key activities performed during the planning phase.
**Answer:**
Planning is the most important phase because it is the basis for the rest of the website. It is at this time that the developers and the client agree on the objective, target market, functionality, and content for the website. Such tasks as developing the site map, choosing the tech stack, cost estimation, and timelines are also accomplished at this point. Planning helps in minimizing mistakes in the development process.

### 6. Explain the iterative nature of the Maintenance phase. Why is a website never truly ”finished”?
**Answer:**
The maintenance phase is iterative because it involves continuous updates and improvements. Websites need regular content updates, bug fixes, security patches, and performance optimization. User needs and technologies keep changing, so a website must evolve over time. Therefore, a website is never truly “finished” and requires ongoing maintenance to remain useful and secure.

### 7. Describe the process of ”Information Gathering.” Why is understanding the target audience crucial during this step?
**Answer:**
Information gathering involves the process by which details are compiled with respect to the needs, goals, competitors, and content of the client. Knowledge of the target audience is very important, as it enables the designing of the website to adhere to the preferences, behavior, and expectations of the target users. This will ensure that the site is friendly, relevant, and efficient in its intended task.

## Group C: Scenario-Based Questions (5 Marks)

### 8. You are the project manager for a new e-commerce site. The client wants to skip the ”Testing” phase to save money and launch early. Write a persuasive argument explaining the potential risks (security, functionality, compatibility) of skipping this phase.
**Answer:**
I would strongly advise the client not to skip the testing phase if I were the project manager. Testing aids in locating security flaws that might reveal client information and online payment credentials. Important features like the checkout system or shopping cart might not function properly without testing, which could annoy customers and lower sales. Additionally, the website might not work properly on some browsers or mobile devices due to compatibility issues. Ignoring this stage could save money at first, but resolving these problems after launch would be far more expensive and detrimental to the company's image.

### 9. A developer begins coding a website immediately after meeting the client, without creating a design prototype or sitemap. Midway through, the client rejects the layout. Analyze what went wrong in the process and how it should have been handled.
**Answer:**
In this case, the main issue was that the developer rushed into coding without spending enough time on planning and design. Because there was no sitemap or prototype, the developer did not fully understand what the client wanted in terms of layout, navigation, and overall look. As a result, the website halfway through development didn’t meet the client’s expectations, which caused frustration and wasted a lot of effort. If I were handling this project, I would have started with proper planning, including creating a sitemap and a design mockup, and then discussed it with the client for feedback and approval. Once the client agreed on the design, coding could begin with a clear direction. This approach would have saved time, avoided unnecessary mistakes, and ensured that the final website matched what the client envisioned. Starting without planning may seem faster, but it often leads to confusion, delays, and extra work that could have been avoided.

### 10. A university website was launched successfully, but after six months, students stopped visiting it because the exam schedules were outdated. Which phase of the development lifecycle was neglected? Explain the activities involved in this phase.
**Answer:**
The part of the website development process that was overlooked was the maintenance phase. The maintenance phase is an ongoing function of a website; websites are never “complete” in the sense of being free from any future updates or changes after they have been made available. During the maintenance phase, content on a website is continually updated; all errors are continuously noted and repaired; Website performance is monitored and continuously improved; Information contained on the website is kept up to date (accurate and relevant). The maintenance phase for a university website would, for example, consist of continually updating exam schedule dates, academic calendar dates, student notices, and any and all other announcements. This phase would also include the continual monitoring of the university website for any and all technical problems as well as the continual monitoring of all links and forms and software/plugins (to protect against security risks) on the website. Not conducting this phase ultimately results in users losing confidence in the website due to not having accurate information and having access to nonfunctioning components, therefore causing a decrease in use of the university website by its intended audience (students, faculty, staff, etc.). In this case, the university website was not updated to list the most current exam schedule. As a result, students have now stopped visiting the university's website. This illustrates the significant need for a maintenance phase to keep users engaged with and satisfied by the website. Continual maintenance will enable the university website to continue to perform up to standard (serving its purpose).
